# Notes â€“ Week 2 Tic Tac Toe Project

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings
1. **DOM Manipulation**  
   - Used `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, and event listeners to handle user clicks and update the board dynamically.  

2. **Game Logic Implementation**  
   - `makeMove()` â†’ Places player symbol (`X` or `O`).  
   - `checkWin()` â†’ Detects win conditions.  
   - `highlightWin()` â†’ Highlights winning combination.  
   - `updateScore()` â†’ Updates scoreboard after each round.  
   - `restartGame()` â†’ Resets only the board.  
   - `resetScores()` â†’ Clears scoreboard.  

3. **AI with Minimax Algorithm** ðŸ¤–  
   - Implemented **Minimax recursion** to ensure the computer plays optimally.  
   - Computer (`O`) always makes the best move possible.  

4. **Styling with CSS**  
   - Created a modern, visually appealing UI.  
   - Assigned **red color to X** and **blue color to O** for clarity.  
   - Added hover and winning cell highlights for better gameplay experience.

## ðŸ§  Challenges Faced
- Implementing the **Minimax algorithm** correctly without slowing down gameplay.  
- Differentiating between **resetting just the game board** vs **resetting the entire scoreboard**.  
- Ensuring UI works well across different screen sizes.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Improvements for Future
- Add **AI difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard).  
- Add **sound effects** for moves and wins.  
- Store scores in **localStorage** so they persist after browser refresh.  
- Enhance **mobile responsiveness** for smaller devices.

## âœ… Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of:  
- **Game development using JavaScript**  
- **Recursive AI algorithms (Minimax)**  
- **Frontend design and UX improvements**  

It was an exciting task that combined **logic building, problem-solving, and UI design** to deliver a complete game experience.

âœ… Task Completed Successfully.
