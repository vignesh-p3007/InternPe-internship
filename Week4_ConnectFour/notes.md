# 🧾 Week 4 Notes – Connect Four Game

## 🔍 Concept Understanding:
- Gained practical experience with **Tkinter Canvas**, **Frame layout**, and **event binding**.
- Implemented **2D list-based game logic** to represent the board.
- Used **loops** and **conditional checks** to detect 4-in-a-row matches.
- Designed a **gradient background** using RGB interpolation for a modern UI.

---

## 🧩 Key Learnings:
1. How to handle user inputs using `<Button-1>` bindings.
2. Managing game states (turns, moves, and scores) efficiently.
3. Implementing a **basic AI** for random computer moves.
4. Structuring Python GUI code using **OOP principles**.
5. Applying **visual feedback** (glow effects) to enhance UX.

---

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced:
- Aligning Tkinter widgets and canvas elements aesthetically.
- Managing redraw operations to avoid lag in gameplay.
- Designing a clean gradient background without external libraries.
- Avoiding index errors while checking for winning conditions.

---

## 🚀 Improvements & Future Enhancements:
- Add **AI difficulty levels** using minimax algorithm.
- Include **sound effects** and animations.
- Add **save/load game** functionality.
- Create a **menu page** for choosing modes or viewing high scores.
- Allow **custom player colors** or themes.

---

## ✅ Summary:
This week’s project enhanced my understanding of **GUI game development** using Tkinter and improved my skills in structuring complex applications with event-driven logic. The Connect Four project marks a strong finish to my **InternPE Python Programming Internship**.
